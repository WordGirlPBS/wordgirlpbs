local chat can be overwhelming and sometimes im offtab so if i dont see ur message just **whisper**

boops and crowns are welcome and appreciated 

my emotes arent stacked that well so sorry for the slow reaction times

im usually in cosplay so if you recognize who im cosplaying feel free to talk to me (especially if its ***wordgirl***)

**if your 15 and under keep interactions to a minimum**

im ass at rp so no serious rp

i usually hang out in the library or in spawn or in the homestuck area with my friends

i love ponywatching it is my favorite activity

go to my [strawpage](https://wordgirlpbs.straw.page/) for general info about me

thats it i think

~~if you see me at the club dont worry bout it~~
